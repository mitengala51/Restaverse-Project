Review Website Setup and Usage Guide

Welcome to the setup and usage documentation for the **Review Website**. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up both the frontend and backend, as well as provide an overview of the websiteâ€™s features. 

Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Node.js (for both frontend and backend development)
- npm (for managing JavaScript packages)
- Access to a Google Business account for integrating Google login to fetch reviews.

Installation Instructions

1. Preparing the Development Environment

Start by opening **VS Code** and setting up two terminal windows:

1. Frontend Terminal: This terminal will be used for working with the frontend of the Review Website.
2. Backend Terminal: This terminal will be dedicated to managing the backend of the Review Website.

2. Navigating to Project Directories

- In the frontend terminal, change the directory to the `frontend` folder:
  ```bash
  cd /path/to/project/frontend
  ```
  
- In the backend terminal, change the directory to the `backend` folder:
  ```bash
  cd /path/to/project/backend
  ```

3. Installing Frontend Dependencies

In the frontend terminal, run the following command to install all necessary modules for the frontend:

```bash
npm install
```

This will download and install all the required dependencies listed in the `package.json` file for the frontend project.

4. Running the Frontend Development Server

Once the frontend dependencies are installed, start the frontend server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will start, and the frontend will be available for local development.

5. Installing Backend Dependencies

Now, move to the backend terminal and install the required backend dependencies by running:

```bash
setup.bat
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies for the backend of the Review Website.

### 6. Starting the Backend Server

Once the backend dependencies are installed, start the backend server with the following command:

```bash
exc.bat
```

This will launch the backend, enabling the Review Website to function correctly.

7. Accessing the Website

After both frontend and backend servers are running, open your preferred web browser and visit the following address to access the Review Website:

```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

This will open the Review Website, where you can begin managing and viewing reviews.

Overview of the Review Website

The Review Website is designed for business owners to easily access and manage customer reviews. Here's a quick overview of the key features:

### Key Features:

- Review Management: The website displays reviews in an organized dashboard. This includes:
  - Review ratings
  - Customer names

How It Works:

1. Google Authentication: Business owners authenticate via Google login, allowing the website to fetch reviews linked to their business account.

3. Review Display: Reviews are displayed in a clean, organized format that includes key details such as customer name, rating, comment, and the date of the review.
4. Replying to Reviews: Owners can respond directly to customer reviews to engage with customers and manage their online reputation.
